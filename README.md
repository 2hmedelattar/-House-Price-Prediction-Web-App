# -House-Price-Prediction-Web-App
A complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices based on structured real estate data. This project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Model Training &amp; Evaluation, and Deployment using Streamlit.
🚀 Project Overview
This project tackles a classic regression problem: predicting house prices using a dataset rich with real estate features. From data preprocessing to deploying a user-friendly web application, every phase of the Machine Learning pipeline is covered.

The app allows users to input features like lot size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, basement size, and more—and instantly see a predicted price based on a trained ML model.
